It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate conditional statements.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

#2  The value returned after I printed a ticket was zero since the amount i put in was just enough to print a single ticket.
#3  The extra money stays in the machine and allows me to use it on my next ticket. If i have to little money, the ticket does not print.
#5  The ticket value changes when it is printed.
#6  public class TicketMachine{Inner part omitted}
#7  Changing the name of the outer wrapper causes the whole script to fail since the names of the objects werent the same anymore.
#8  Removing public doesnt change anything from the priner.
#9  Romvinfg class makes the whole project not work
#10 The constructor of this source code is called the (Public TicketMachine)
#11 The constructors are capitlalized because they need to copy the name of the object their controlling.
#12 private int count: The initial value of whatever youre inputting to the code. Private student represnatative: Member of a student class. Private server host: The client that the code is being written on.
#13 The names are Alive, Tutor, Game.
#14 Student representative, Person tutor, Server host and Game game.
#15 The code can be changed between eachother aslong as there is only 1 copy of each name.
#16 yes it is a must to add a semicolon since that declares the statement that you made. 
#17 int status;
#18 there is no class
#19 it has 1 public
#20 No, they don't need a persistent storage.
#21 public Pet(String petsName)
{

this.name = petsName;

}
#23 The header is an int and the body is a void. The body is also used with the =.
#24 How much is in the ticket machine?
#25 yes, you need to change every instance of the word balance to amount.
#27 there is a syntax error since there is no price to the machine anymore
#28 getprice is a statement and print ticket is a command so get price will remain the same and print ticket will change depending on if there is enough money.
#29 No, They are not return statements because it is a system output.
#31  /**

*/{
this.score += points;
}
#32 yes, the method changes the value of balance since the objects state is mutated.
#33 PUBLIC VOID DISCOUNT (INT AMOUNT)
{ 
 price+ price - amount;
}

#34 public void setAge (int currentage)
{
   this.age=currentAge;
}
#37 it reads: "My cat has green eyes"

#39 The actual price of the ticket wont show meaning that rthew word "price will show since you won't be requesting the actual price.
#40 The # price and cents word will show since they are in quotation marks.
